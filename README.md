# Ridit: Ridit Analysis (An extension of the Kruskal-Wallis Test.)
An extension of the Kruskal-Wallis Test that allow selection of arbitrary reference group. Also provide Mean Ridit for each group. Mean Ridit of a group is an estimate of probability a random observation from that group will be greater than or equal to a random observation from reference group.
This aforementioned method is discussed in "Design and Analysis of Clinical Experiments" by Joseph L. Fleiss.
